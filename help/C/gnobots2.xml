     <title>Introduction</title>

     <para>
       <application>GNOME Robots</application> is a game where you try
       and avoid a band of marauding robots which are,
       for no adequately explained reason, trying to kill you. It is
       based on the text-based robots game which can be found
       on a number of UNIX systems.
     </para>
     <para>
       This new version includes two types of robots, movable
       junkheaps, multiple game configurations, user definable
       keyboard layouts, and sound, as well as all of the features
       which were present in the original GNOME Robots game.
     </para>

     <para>
       To run <application>GNOME Robots</application>, select
       <menuchoice>
       <guisubmenu>Games</guisubmenu>
       <guimenuitem>Robots</guimenuitem>
       </menuchoice>
       from the <guimenu>Main Menu</guimenu>, or type
       <command>gnobots2</command> on the command line.
     </para>

     <para>
       <application>GNOME Robots</application> is included in the
       <filename>gnome-games</filename> package, which is part of the
       GNOME desktop environment. This document describes version
       &appversion; of <application>GNOME Robots</application>.
     </para>
   </sect1>
 
   <sect1 id="objective">
     <title>GNOME Robots Objective</title>
     <para>
       The objective of GNOME Robots is quite simple. You are surrounded by a 
       number of robots or other hostile adversaries. As you move about 
       they will move directly towards you for every move that you make. 
       Their goal is to kill you. Your goal is to kill all the robots on the 
       board by taking advantage of their vulnerabilities. 
     </para>
   
     <para>
       Robots are destroyed when they collide with each other, or when they
       collide with the debris of some previous collision. You die if a robot
       ends up right next to you.
     </para>

     <para> In some of the game configurations (you can choose from
       five different sets of rules), you can push the
       junkheaps around to form barricades to protect you. Also, if you
       are daring enough, you can Splat! the robots by pushing
       junkheaps on top of them for an additional bonus.  </para>
     <para>
       You can also save yourself by teleporting yourself to a random location. 
       Unfortunately, randomly teleporting means that
       you might end up being right next to a robot, so they can kill you when
       they make their move. Luckily, there are also
       safe teleports which will place you out of immediate danger, but
       there are only a limited supply of them. You can earn
       more free teleports as you go along (how you gain them depends on the 
       chosen game), but typically you get one for each robot that is
       destroyed while you are 'waiting', up to a maximum of 10. If you don't
       want to waste your saved-up safe teleports, you can choose to teleport
       randomly if you think it's safe enough. 
     </para>
   
     <para>
       If you press the <guibutton>Wait</guibutton> button (see below) you will no longer be able to
       move until either all of the robots (which still move towards you) are
       gone, or you are killed. Doing this is risky, but may earn you extra 
       safe teleports.
     </para>
   
     <para> If you manage to reach the point where more than half of
       the screen is occupied by robots, the number of robots will be
       reset to the starting amount, allowing you to continue.
     </para>

        appropriate key on the keyboard (keypad by default). Clicking on the little man
        will keep you still. To teleport (safely or unsafely), and to
        wait, use the buttons on the toolbar or use the items in the

        the middle of a game, so they will be disabled then. There are
        also several options at the bottom of the dialog:

      Any graphics files which are placed in the directory are auto-detected,
      so you don't need to alter any configuration files.
      You can also define your own game configurations by creating extra
      <filename>
      .cfg
      </filename> files which are stored in the 
      <filename class="directory">
      $PREFIX/share/gnobots2
      </filename>
      directory.
